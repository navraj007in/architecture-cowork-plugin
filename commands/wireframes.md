description: Generate screen spec JSON files (NOT HTML) — one .json file per screen, rendered natively by Archon

# /architect:wireframes

## CRITICAL — Output Format

**You MUST write `.json` files only. This is not optional.**

| ✅ Correct | ❌ Wrong |
|-----------|---------|
| `dashboard.json` | `dashboard.html` |
| `users-list.json` | `wireframes.html` |
| `_manifest.json` | Any `.html`, `.css`, `.tsx`, `.jsx` file |

If you are about to write an HTML file, STOP. This command does not generate HTML. Archon renders the JSON natively — no HTML is needed or wanted.

## Why JSON (not HTML)

JSON specs are ~20 lines per screen. Archon renders them as polished wireframes natively. Generating HTML would:
- Exceed the output token limit (15 screens × 200 lines HTML = 3,000 lines)
- Produce files Archon cannot render
- Defeat the purpose of this command

Each screen = one `.json` file, ~20-30 lines. 15 screens = ~400 lines total. All in one run.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Manifest

Check if `architecture-output/wireframes/_manifest.json` exists with a non-empty `generated` array. If all screens already exist, output `[WIREFRAMES_DONE]` and stop.

### Step 2: Read Context

**First**, check for `architecture-output/_state.json`. If it exists, read it in full and extract:
- `project.name` → appName
- `design` → brand color (`primary`), personality, and fonts — record these for the `theme` field in each spec
- `entities` → field names for realistic placeholder values in specs

**Then** read the SDL — **only if `_state.json` is absent or missing `project.name`**; Grep for `product:` block (screens, coreFlows, auth) and `components:` block only. Do NOT read the full SDL file.

### Step 3: Build Manifest

Using the **wireframe-patterns** skill, map SDL to a screen inventory. Write `architecture-output/wireframes/_manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "appName": "MyApp",
  "screens": [
    { "id": "login", "title": "Login" },
    { "id": "dashboard", "title": "Dashboard" }
  ],
  "generated": []
}
```

### Step 4: Generate All JSON Specs

For each screen, write `architecture-output/wireframes/{id}.json`.

See **wireframe-patterns** skill for section types and examples per screen type.

Key rules:
- `layout`: `"centered"` for auth, `"sidebar"` for apps with many nav items, `"topnav"` otherwise, `"fullpage"` for landing
- `navLinks`: map nav label → screen id (e.g. `"Students": "students-list"`)
- `sections`: use real entity field names from SDL data section, realistic placeholder values
- `theme`: include a `theme` object in each spec if `_state.json.design` is available:
  ```json
  "theme": {
    "primary": "#f97316",
    "personality": "bold-commercial",
    "headingFont": "Clash Display",
    "bodyFont": "Poppins"
  }
  ```
  If no design context exists, omit the `theme` field entirely.

### Step 5: Update Manifest

Rewrite `_manifest.json` with all screen ids in `generated`.

### Step 6: Signal

Output: `[WIREFRAMES_DONE] All {N} screens generated.`
